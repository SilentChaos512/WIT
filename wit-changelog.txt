Delete your config file for best results. The entire config file structure has changed.

Added: A config GUI! Configure WIT in-game through the Mods/Mod Options menu!
Added: Harvestability info. Still needs work, but it accurately tells whether or not you can harvest a block (just not with which tool in many cases).
