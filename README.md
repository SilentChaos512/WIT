A Minecraft mod similar to WAILA.

This mod was originally intended to be a temporary replacement for WAILA. At the time, WAILA for Minecraft 1.8 was a bit broken and annoying to use. Ironically, a new version of WAILA was released yesterday. So, this mod might be a bit unnecessary, but I'll keep working on it for now for my own enjoyment.
